 *it's a industrial training which has been designed for 2nd year & 3rd year*  

Guys, *this is really a great opportunity* and you shouldn't think twice before applying.

There are no age barriers to gain knowledge. *From my personal experience, I can say Industrial training are a pretty important factor in deciding one's career*.

11/12/2020, 23:14 - +91 72191 60238: basic questions hi puche, experiments ke theory, post lab and pre lab related...
11/12/2020, 23:14 - +91 72191 60238: i dont think advantages puche... clipper clamper ka working, definition and application pucha
11/12/2020, 23:14 - +91 72191 60238: mujhse negative series clipper pucha toh usme bolna tha ki diode is forward biased in the positive half cycle, so it is in conduction mode and current flows and we see the waveform in the output but in the negative half cycle, diode is reverse biased because the p type is connected to the negative terminal of the external voltage so no current flows and we dont see any output. so negative series clipper clips off the entire negative portion

21/01/2021, 16:42 - Sheer Sr: Okay so it begins with rotary. Rotary is when professionals come together and they have clubs. 
Under that are Rotaract clubs which are formed by students aged 18-30 and they run the body under the mentorship of a specific rotary club. 

Types of clubs 
Rotaract clubs are either based on institutions (like our club of SNDT Women's University) or by community (for example rotaract club of bombay west). 

What do rotaract clubs do? 
Rotaract clubs do community service events, international events, like webinars on various topics, student exchange programs on international level, beach clean ups, tree plantation drives, marathon and everything under the sun that could be a potential event for the society, youth, elders, children, etc

09/04/2021, 20:47 - Kanika: This message was deleted
09/04/2021, 20:47 - Kanika: Hello guys, some of the ideas which we got are:

1.Marvel characters
2.Women empowerment
3.western and traditional clothing
4.famous applications
(G meet, G classroom, moodle...)

5.chocolates

We are really confused, u can suggest if you like any of these or if you have got better ideas
09/04/2021, 20:48 - Kanika: Jaise 
•Beach dresses
•Cocktail party dresses
•Weeding/ethinic dresses
•Casual dresses
•Formal dresses
09/04/2021, 20:50 - Sheer Sr: Please respond asap. If you dont like any of the idea then do suggest something.
09/04/2021, 20:50 - +91 81082 22900: The famous applications one sounds good, but wasn't done earlier too?
09/04/2021, 20:51 - +91 81082 22900: Also, to just throw in the mix, disney characters are good too, a lot of diversity, also something eye-catching about everyone
09/04/2021, 20:52 - Maseera: That disney cartoon we already did last year
09/04/2021, 20:52 - Kanika: Ya, since applications got even more famous this time so ...
But you are right we should exclude that one
09/04/2021, 20:53 - +91 81082 22900: Ok.
09/04/2021, 20:53 - Sheer Sr: Women clothing pr kr sakte hai. 
Like uk saree ka chota blouse backless chalta hai  but crop tops are bad
Fashion k liye beanies and scarf pehente hai toh chalta but hijab pehne religiously toh oppression wagera

Basically every woman should be treated w same respect no matter what they wear
09/04/2021, 20:55 - Sheer Sr: What do you guys think about this?
Idea presented by one of our classmate ... she didn't want to reveal her name😂
09/04/2021, 20:55 - Kanika: https://youtu.be/kLJ9DD8oADo
09/04/2021, 20:56 - Kanika: Please check this one out
09/04/2021, 20:56 - Kanika: Women empowerment...
09/04/2021, 20:56 - Krupali Pimple: Yeah ye bhi acha hai 👍
09/04/2021, 20:57 - Sheer Sr: Mst h

09/04/2021, 20:57 - Kanika: Sabka prop same nhi hoga
09/04/2021, 20:57 - Kanika: Chalega kya
09/04/2021, 20:58 - Sheer Sr: Han thoda modify krna pdega isko same thodi krenge
09/04/2021, 20:58 - +91 95035 75411: Ya this is cool
09/04/2021, 20:58 - Maseera: We can find something common na. Jo sabke paas mile
09/04/2021, 20:59 - Kanika: Ya right
09/04/2021, 20:59 - +91 97029 62820: yess
09/04/2021, 20:59 - Krupali Pimple: Yeah chalega
09/04/2021, 20:59 - +91 81082 22900: Even a bit different wouldn't affect much.
09/04/2021, 20:59 - +91 81082 22900: The focus is ok the action itself there.
09/04/2021, 21:00 - Kanika: Okay
09/04/2021, 21:00 - Sheer Sr: But hum as it is nhi le skte plagarism ka issue hoga kuch changes suggest kro
09/04/2021, 21:01 - Krupali Pimple: Oooo bhai plagiarism bhi hai 😂
09/04/2021, 21:01 - Maseera: We can cut a tomato or onion thing na. Idea le sakte hai. Exact mat banao
09/04/2021, 21:01 - +91 81082 22900: Some other gender specific action?
09/04/2021, 21:01 - Krupali Pimple: Itna bhi check karenge 🙄
09/04/2021, 21:01 - Sheer Sr: Hota h
09/04/2021, 21:02 - +91 81082 22900: Even that seems appropriate
09/04/2021, 21:02 - Kanika: Changes toh ho jayenge ...like we will have to give our own voice, and some scripting needs ko be done
09/04/2021, 21:02 - Sheer Sr: Hume photo leni h sabhko apni photos bhejni h drive pe and then we have to make fast video
09/04/2021, 21:02 - Kanika: Yeah😂

*IEEE VJTI* presents to you:

*👩‍🎓 effective TECHNICAL PAPER*
*WRITING*👩‍🎓

*What is a technical paper?*

A technical paper is a research paper that describes a problem that you have solved either theoretically or by experiment. 

*Why do we need to learn to write technical paper?*

Writing a technical paper for your research or projects, for submission to a Symposium or Paper Presentation can be a daunting task, especially if you are not accustomed to doing this sort of writing. Every year, many papers are not accepted, even when the technical content was probably quite good. 

🗓️ *Date:* 10th October, Sunday

⏰ *Timings:* 4PM - 5PM

👉 *Where* : Google Meet

📚 *Prerequisites:* Basic English writing skills

👨🏻‍🏫 *Speaker:* Dr. Shrikrishna V. Kulkarni (Institute Chair Professor, EE Dept., IIT Bombay)
